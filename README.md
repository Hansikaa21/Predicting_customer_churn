# Predicting_customer_churn
This project aims to predict customer churn using various machine learning models. It evaluates the performance of models both **before and after hyperparameter optimization**, and provides detailed performance metrics and visualizations such as ROC curves.

## Project Overview
Customer churn refers to when a customer stops using a company’s services. Predicting churn can help businesses improve customer retention and minimize revenue loss. In this project, we apply and compare multiple machine learning models to predict churn with a focus on accuracy and performance.

## Models Used
The following models have been implemented:
- ✅ Logistic Regression  
- ✅ Random Forest  
- ✅ Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)  
- ✅ AdaBoost  
Each model is trained and tested on the dataset, and performance is evaluated **before and after optimization**.

## Performance Metrics
For each model, we calculate the following metrics:
- **MAE** (Mean Absolute Error)  
- **MSE** (Mean Squared Error)  
- **RMSE** (Root Mean Squared Error)  
- **R² Score** (Coefficient of Determination)  
- **ROC AUC Score** (Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve)
